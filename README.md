Overview
========

**Convert iTunes playlists into MP3 CDs in one click â€” it works even if the playlist contains songs not in MP3 format!**

Select a music playlist from your iTunes library, then all its songs will be automatically converted to MP3 format in the desired quality and burned to a CD. It works with most audio files in your iTunes library (e.g. in MP3, AAC, AIFF or WAV format) and does not require manipulating your iTunes library or playlists in any way.

IMPORTANT: 
* A Mac with an optical drive capable of burning CDs (e.g. Apple SuperDrive) is required. 
* DRM protected audio files (e.g. songs purchased on the iTunes Store before iTunes Plus was announced) cannot be converted to MP3 format.
